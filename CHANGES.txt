0.1 - Initial release

0.2 - 2015-10-07
* Add support for partial document update
* Add support for Kibana
* Fix User Defined Type creation
* Change cassandra StorageService hooks to start Elasticsearch (Fix commitlogs recover)

0.3.2 - 2015-11-05 (Based on cassandra-2.1.8 + elasticsearch 1.5.1)
* Bug fixes
 * Fix multiget on a multiple nodes cluster (Allow to save kibana configuration on multi-node cluster).
 * Fix a bug in cluster state management when restarting. 
 * Fix CASSANDRA-9912
 
* New features
 * Add support for compound cassandra keys. 
 * Add support for partial CQL update of cassandra collection types.
 * Enhance Elasticsearch put mapping to automatically build mapping from an existing CQL3 table.
 * Replace the single_value mapping attribute by cql_collection, cql_struct and cql_partial_update. This allow to map nested document to a User Defined Types or to a cassandra map<text,?>.

 0.4 - 2015-11-11 (Based on cassandra-2.1.8 + elasticsearch 1.5.1)
  * Fix various bugs
  * New tarball package.
  
0.4.1 - 2015-11-17
  * Bug fix when indexing inet type (Internet Address).

0.4.2 - 2015-11-23
  * Improve automatic mapping from an existing CQL3 table.
  
0.5 - 2015-12-21
  * Based on cassandra 2.2.4
  * Improve mapping and cassandra secondary index management :
    * to map a keyspace to many Elasticserach indices allowing mapping update with zero-downtime.
    * to create cassandra secondary indices when all shards are started, thus indexing existing data on all nodes.
    
2.1.1 - 2016-01-22
  * Based on Elasticsearch 2.1.1 and Apache Cassandra 2.2.4
  * Manage the _token field as an internal metadata field. This is the murmur3 hash of the partition key for cassandra row (an Elasticsearch document).
  * Index settings number_of_shards and number_of_replicas now dynamically reflects the number of nodes in the ES cluster (in the cassandra datacenter) and the replication factor for each index (= keyspace).

2.1.1-1 - 2016-02-03
  * Add support for parent-child relation-ship
  * Bug fix when indexing inet type (Internet Address).

2.1.1-2 - 2016-02-16
  * Elassandra now build as a standalone project.
  * Add a modified bin/cassandra.in.sh without empty element in CLASSPATH (cause a JarHell error)

2.1.1-3 - 2016-02-21
  * Add a start script for Linux Debian provided by Chris Feldmeier.
  * Add sigar binaries in the tarball package.
  * Fix the build_hash in the cluster information.

2.1.1-4 - 2016-02-21
  * Throw a DocumentAlreadyExsistsException when op_type=create failed.
  * Fix a bug on cassandra timestamp when indexing or deleting documents.

2.1.1-5 - 2016-03-15
  * Add missing classes from org.elasticsearch.common.logging.
  * Add index setting number_of_replica in cluster state.
  * Change elastic_admin keyspace replication strategy to 'DatacenterReplicationStrategy' (RF=Datacenter number of nodes to improve resilancy).
  * Manage token_range in SearchRequest has an optional field to remain compatible with the Elasticsearch binary protocol.
  * Set Elasticsearch version to 2.1.1 to remain compatible with some plugins.
  
2.1.1-6 - 2016-03-20
  * Fix an indexing bug (regression from 2.1.1-5)
  * Disable cassandra timestamp update when Elasticsearch _timestamp is disabled (improve insert performance, regression from 2.1.1-4)
  * Fix a bug on flush and refresh operations causing a performance issue with kibana.
  
2.1.1-7 - 2016-04-02
  * Fix a ClassCastException when indexing a document with single partition key other than a string.
  * Add support for mapping update of nested object (update cassandra UDT).
  
2.1.1-8 - 2016-04-18
  * Add mapping attributes cql_partition_key:boolean and cql_primary_key_order:integer to build cassandra table with composite primary key.
  * Add support for static column with the mapping attribute cql_static_column:boolean. This give the ability to index static columns in Elasticsearch.
  * Fix various mapping issues.

2.1.1-9 - 2016-05-10
  * Upgrade to cassandra 2.2.5
  * Change the default elasticsearch data directory to ${cassandra_storagedir}/data/elasticsearch.data.
  * Provides various cassandra secondary index implementations with better performances by removing json generation and parsing.
  * Improve cluster metadata management (fix a bug when deleting an index).
  * Fix a mapping bug when indexing a cassandra map as a nested document.
  * Mapping of cassandra text columns are now index with index=not_analyzed by default.
  * Improve support for geo_point.
